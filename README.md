text_wrap.py: This program has a function, which uses text wrapper and I am passing 13 which indicates that a line can only hold 13 characters and then it breaks into a new line once the limit has been reached.
It maintains 13 characters, but it doesn't break the words and just places the next word into the following line.
test_unit.py: This holds the unit test case.
